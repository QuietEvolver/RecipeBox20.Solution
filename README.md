## Description
A program app  that allows users to keep track of recipes ex. names and ingredients (such as flour or barley).

### Steps/Use Case:

| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------ | :------------- |
| **Homepage** | User accesses:http://localhost:5000/| User vies:Landing Homepage |
| **User enters in a recipe's name | I: Type: "Dessert" , Recipe Name: "Pumpkin Pie" | None;|
| **User clicks button and recipe's info is populated | I: (click button) | O: Id: "1", Type: "Dessert" , Recipe Name: "Pumpkin Pie"|As a user, I want to add a recipe with ingredients and instructions, so I remember how to prepare my favorite dishes.

As a user, I can: 
 - tag my recipes with different categories, so recipes are easier to find. A recipe can have many tags and a tag can have many recipes.
 - update and delete tags, so I can have flexibility with how I categorize recipes.
 - edit my recipes, so I can make improvements or corrections to my recipes.
 - delete recipes I don't like or use, so I don't have to see them as choices.
 - rate my recipes, so I know which ones are the best.
 - list my recipes by highest rated so I can see which ones I like the best.
 - see all recipes that use a certain ingredient, so I can more easily find recipes for the ingredients I have.
